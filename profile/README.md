## Title of the Project 

Rice farming management app with rice leaf diseases identification (Rifsa or Rice Farmer Assistant).

## Abstract

Reviewing the activities of local residents who are farmers, they often complain such as forgetting to record when purchasing agricultural needs, missing book notes, and lack of information about diseases in rice plants. For these complaints and the current ease of internet access, We want to create an application that helps farmers in managing agriculture. Where the features in the application have a system for recording crop yields, finance, inventory, recording agricultural activities, weather forecasting, and rice leaf disease detection. We hope that this application can overcome food security related issues such as crop failures. Therefore, this can improve the welfare of farmers.
